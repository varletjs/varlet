# Developer Guide

### Intro
First, thank you for your interest in joining our development. Here are some considerations.

### Quickstart
The project is based on the `workspace` feature of yarn and `lerna` as the basic architecture of Monorepo. 
The first fork of the repository is based on the dev branch, which is in the project root directory.

```shell
yarn bootstrap
cd packages/varlet-ui
yarn dev
```

- 2.Improve the document reading experience and fix problems.
- 3.Unit test all components and issue test report.
- 4.Full component style detail optimization, animation curve optimization.
