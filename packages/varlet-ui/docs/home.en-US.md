### Material Design Introduction
Material Design, Is a new design language from Google that aims to provide a more consistent and broader 
"look and feel" for phones, tablets, desktops and "other platforms".

### Why Material
In the early mobile devices, large color blocks and strong contrast colors had high requirements for display devices, 
while non-linear animation and water ripples had certain requirements for GPU.
As a result, Material style does not have a good experience in the mobile browser environment, and more flat and simple style is chosen to be put into the product.
But as modern devices and new JS frameworks become more efficient at runtime processing, 
browsers have more free time, and the ability to process animations, and Material Design will bring a better experience to applications.
