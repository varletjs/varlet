### UMD module exports Chinese and English language packages

In the `1.x` version, the UMD module did not export the Chinese and English language packs. In the `2.x` version, we exported the Chinese and English language packs by default.
Non-UMD modules now have two ways to use language packs

```ts
// playground-ignore
import { Locale } from '@varlet/ui'
import enUS from '@varlet/ui/es/locale/en-US'

Locale.add('en-US', enUS)
````

OR

```ts
// playground-ignore
import { Locale } from '@varlet/ui'

Locale.add('en-US', Locale.enUS)
````

### UMD module export dark mode theme

In `1.x` version, UMD module is not exported for dark mode theme package, in `2.x` version, we export dark mode theme package,
Non-UMD modules now have two ways to use the dark mode theme

```ts
// playground-ignore
import { StyleProvider } from '@varlet/ui'
import dark from '@varlet/ui/es/themes/dark'

StyleProvider(dark)
````

OR

```ts
// playground-ignore
import { StyleProvider, Themes } from '@varlet/ui'

StyleProvider(Themes.dark)
````

### Remove less theme variable support

Now that the `css variable` solution is very mature, the `less` theme variable is no longer supported in the `2.x` version, which is conducive to reducing the release size of the package.
If you use a scheme that replaces the `less` theme variable at build time, you need to replace it with the `css variable` scheme

### Typescript type optimization

We refactored the internal types of components, abstracting more types and exposing them. The type specification of components is in the form of `component name` + `type name`. Use as follows

```ts
// playground-ignore
import type { ButtonProps, ButtonType, ButtonSize } from '@varlet/ui'
````

### Supports automatic introduction of function components

In 1.x, the component library only supports declarative components that are automatically imported into templates, and functional components `(eg: Snackbar)` still need to manually import style files.
In 2.x, the automatic import of function components is supported through the [unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) plugin.
For details, see [Import On Demand](#/en-US/importOnDemand)

## Components Library Tools(@varlet/cli)

### Command refactoring

- Refactored `gen` and `create` commands, added `sfc` and `tsx` template options, added internationalization options, and optimized the command line interactive experience
- Refactored `compile` command, compiled package no longer supports `less` variable
- Added `vite:dev` and `vite:build` commands to basically encapsulate `vite`
